# Agent Working Procedure

1. Review the code base and prepare for work based on the `## Developer Requirements` section below.
2. If the last section is a developer section like `## Developer Requirements Update` or `## Developer Review Response`, skip the middle and start from there.
3. If you need a decision from the developer, add a section called `## Agent Review Request` at the end of this file and stop working.
4. When work is finished, add a section called `## Agent Work Execution : {yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm}` at the end of this file and describe what you did.
5. When updating documents, **do not delete or overwrite** existing requirements, plans, or reviews. Always add new information to the **end** of the file.
6. When making a plan, do not give multiple choices like "A or B". Specify **one clear implementation path**.
7. For other general rules, check [ai_agent_guide.md](/docs/guide/ai_agent_guide.md).
